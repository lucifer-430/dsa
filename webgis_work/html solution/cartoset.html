    CARTOSAT–1 is the first Indian Remote Sensing Satellite capable of providing in-orbit stereo images. 
    The images were used for Cartographic applications meeting the global requirements.
     Cameras of this satellite have a resolution of 2.5m (can distinguish a small car).
    The Cartosat–1 provided stereo pairs required for generating Digital Elevation Models, 
    Ortho Image products, and Value added products for various applications of Geographical 
    Information System (GIS).
